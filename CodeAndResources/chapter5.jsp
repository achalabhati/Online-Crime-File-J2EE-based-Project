      <li>&nbsp;<ol>
        <li>Subject to the provisions of this Act, it shall be the duty of the 
        Central Information Commission or State Information Commission, as the 
        case may be, to receive and inquire into a complaint from any person,–
        <ol type="a">
          <li>who has been unable to submit a request to a Central Public 
          Information Officer or State Public Information Officer, as the case 
          may be, either by reason that no such officer has been appointed under 
          this Act, or because the Central Assistant Public Information Officer 
          or State Assistant Public Information Officer, as the case may be, has 
          refused to accept his or her application for information or appeal 
          under this Act for forwarding the same to the Central Public 
          Information Officer or State Public Information Officer or senior 
          officer specified in sub-section (1) of section 19 or the Central 
          Information Commission or the State Information Commission, as the 
          case may be;</li>
          <li>who has been refused access to any information requested under 
          this Act;</li>
          <li>who has not been given a response to a request for information or 
          access to information within the time limit specified under this Act;</li>
          <li>who has been required to pay an amount of fee which he or she 
          considers unreasonable;</li>
          <li>who believes that he or she has been given incomplete, misleading 
          or false information under this Act; and</li>
          <li>in respect of any other matter relating to requesting or obtaining 
          access to records under this Act.</li>
        </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Where the Central Information Commission or State Information 
        Commission, as the case may be, is satisfied that there are reasonable 
        grounds to inquire into the matter, it may initiate an inquiry in 
        respect thereof.</li>
        <li>The Central Information Commission or State Information Commission, 
        as the case may be, shall, while inquiring into any matter under this 
        section, have the same powers as are vested in a civil court while 
        trying a suit under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, in respect of the 
        following matters, namely:–
        <ol type="a">
          <li>summoning and enforcing the attendance of persons and compel them 
          to give oral or written evidence on oath and to produce the documents 
          or things;</li>
          <li>requiring the discovery and inspection of documents;</li>
          <li>receiving evidence on affidavit;</li>
          <li>requisitioning any public record or copies thereof from any court 
          or office;</li>
          <li>issuing summons for examination of witnesses or documents; and</li>
          <li>any other matter which may be prescribed.</li>
        </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Notwithstanding anything inconsistent contained in any other Act of 
        Parliament or State Legislature, as the case may be, the Central 
        Information Commission or the State Information Commission, as the case 
        may be, may, during the inquiry of any complaint under this Act, examine 
        any record to which this Act applies which is under the control of the 
        public authority, and no such record may be withheld from it on any 
        grounds.</li>
      </ol>
      </li>
      <li>&nbsp;<ol>
        <li>Any person who, does not receive a decision within the time 
        specified in sub-section (1) or clause (a) of sub-section (3) of section 
        7, or is aggrieved by a decision of the Central Public Information 
        Officer or State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, may 
        within thirty days from the expiry of such period or from the receipt of 
        such a decision prefer an appeal to such officer who is senior in rank 
        to the Central Public Information Officer or State Public Information 
        Officer as the case may be, in each public authority:<br>
        Provided that such officer may admit the appeal after the expiry of the 
        period of thirty days if he or she is satisfied that the appellant was 
        prevented by sufficient cause from filing the appeal in time. </li>
        <li>Where an appeal is preferred against an order made by a Central 
        Public Information Officer or a State Public Information Officer, as the 
        case may be, under section 11 to disclose third party information, the 
        appeal by the concerned third party shall be made within thirty days 
        from the date of the order.</li>
        <li>A second appeal against the decision under sub-section (1) shall lie 
        within ninety days from the date on which the decision should have been 
        made or was actually received, with the Central Information Commission 
        or the State Information Commission:<br>
        Provided that the Central Information Commission or the State 
        Information Commission, as the case may be, may admit the appeal after 
        the expiry of the period of ninety days if it is satisfied that the 
        appellant was prevented by sufficient cause from filing the appeal in 
        time. </li>
        <li>If the decision of the Central Public Information Officer or State 
        Public Information Officer, as the case may be, against which an appeal 
        is preferred relates to information of a third party, the Central 
        Information Commission or State Information Commission, as the case may 
        be, shall give a reasonable opportunity of being heard to that third 
        party.</li>
        <li>In any appeal proceedings, the onus to prove that a denial of a 
        request was justified shall be on the Central Public Information Officer 
        or State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, who denied the 
        request.</li>
        <li>An appeal under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) shall be disposed 
        of within thirty days of the receipt of the appeal or within such 
        extended period not exceeding a total of forty-five days from the date 
        of filing thereof, as the case may be, for reasons to be recorded in 
        writing.</li>
